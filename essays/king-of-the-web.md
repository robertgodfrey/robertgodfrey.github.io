## JavaScript Runs The World

Since its introduction over 25 years ago, JavaScript (JS) has become the king of web development - it's estimated that 98% of websites today use JS to implement client-side webpage behavior. Additionally, in recent years JS has expanded outside of web development and has found other uses, including application development (through platforms such as React Native and Cordova) and embedded systems.  

## Scripting Languages vs. Programming Languages

Scripting languages differ from traditional programming languages in a few ways. The most notable differences, in my opinion, are that scripting languages do not require strongly-typed variables and usually do not require a compile stage to be executed. These rules make things a little easier for the developer, and typically projects can be completed faster using a scripting language rather than a traditional programming language. However, the ease of use and flexibility that scripting languages offer comes at a cost: programs written in scripting languages are usually slower than those written in a traditional programming language, due to scripting languages being interpreted as they are executed.

## My JS Experience

I have minimal experience coding with JS - my first exposure to JS was a few semesters ago when I took ICS 215 (Intro to Scripting) and I haven't touched it since. Some aspects of JS are refreshing, such as the weakly-typed variables (we don't need to think at all about what type of variables to declare) and the lack of required semicolon (though it is recommended, it's nice to not have to worry about it when running small tests). In my opinion, JS is an ideal language for quick coding and quick testing. JS syntax is similar enough to Java and C that it makes sense for me without having to think too hard about anything (compared to, for example, Python). That being said, I was completely unfamiliar with ES6 before this module, and I think I will need a lot of practice with the concepts that were introduced before I feel comfortable with them - which segues nicely into...

## Athletic Software Engineering

I like the idea of athletic software engineering. I am competitive, so I think that the WODs in this course will motivate me to review and practice concepts until I feel confident enough to achieve the prescribed time. Years ago, I used to do Crossfit fairly often and it was always fun to compete against the other people in the gym, against the clock, and against myself. I enjoy a challenge and I am looking forward to being tested under pressure.
