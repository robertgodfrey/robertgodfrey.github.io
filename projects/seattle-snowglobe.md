    This is a snow globe "souvenir" that can be viewed in augmented reality on a smartphone. It uses a <a href="https://mergeedu.com/cube" target="_blank">Merge Cube</a> to determine where to project the 3D object onto the screen; the user holds the cube in their hand and on the screen, it appears as though they are holding the snow globe. Users can tap a specific building or object on the screen to see a fact about that item.

    I created this application in Unity and built the 3D models in Blender.
