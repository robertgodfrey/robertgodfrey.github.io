STEPN Sidekick is a mobile application that I created during summer break. Developed as a companion application for the popular move-to-earn game STEPN, STEPN Sidekick helps players optimize their in-game sneakers and gives audible speed and time alerts while the user walks/jogs/runs. The application was originally built natively for Android (Java & XML) and is in the process of being rebuilt natively for iOS (Swift/SwiftUI). 

I learned a lot while working on this project. One of my main focuses was creating a user interface that is simple, smooth, and intuitive. This is the first project that I have published and it is my first experience using Swift & Xcode. I also broadened my knowledge of Android Studio with the implementation of features such as user location, audio, foreground services, API calls, advertisements, and in-app purchases, to name a few. I also translated the app entirely into Korean (with some help). 

STEPN Sidekick currently has over 2,500 downloads and has an average rating of 5 stars on the Play Store.
