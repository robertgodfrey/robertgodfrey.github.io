<div class="d-flex">

    This is a snow globe "souvenir" that can be viewed in augmented reality on a smartphone. It uses a <a href="https://mergeedu.com/cube" target="_blank">Merge Cube</a> to determine where to project the 3D object onto the screen; the user holds the cube in their hand and on the screen, it appears as though they are holding the snow globe. Users can tap a specific building or object on the screen to see a fact about that item.

    I created this application in Unity and built the 3D models in Blender. This was my first time building anything with Unity and my first time creating 3D models (after following the famous Blender <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIoXOplUvAw" target="_blank">donut tutorial</a>).
